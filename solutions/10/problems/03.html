<h2>Searching a sorted compact list</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/10/03/04.html">Exercise 10.3-4</a> asked how we might maintain an $n$-element list compactly in
the first $n$ positions of an array. We shall assume that the keys are
distinct and that the compact list is also sorted, that is, <code>key[i] &lt;
key[next[i]]</code> for all $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$ such that <code>next[i] ≠ NIL</code>. We
will also assume that we have a variable $L$ that contains the index of the
first element on the list. Under these assumptions, you will show that we
can use the following randomized algorithm to search the list in
$\O(\sqrt{n})$ expected time.</p>

<pre><code>COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH(L, n, k)
  i = L
  while i ≠ ␀ and key[i] &lt; k
      j = RANDOM(1, n)
      if key[i] &lt; key[j] and key[j] ≤ k
          i = j
          if key[i] == k
              return i
      i = next[i]
  if i == ␀ or key[i] &gt; k
      return ␀
</code></pre>

<p>If we ignore lines 3-7 of the procedure, we have an ordinary algorithm for
searching a sorted linked list, in which index $i$ points to each position
of the list in turn. The search terminates once the index $i$ "falls off"
the end of the list or once <code>key[i] ≥ k</code>. In the latter case, if <code>key[i] =
k</code>, clearly we have found a key with value $k$. If, however, <code>key[i] &gt; k</code>,
then we will never find a key with the value $k$, and so terminating the
search was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>Lines 3-7 attempt to skip ahead to a randomly chosen position $j$. Such a
skip benefits us if <code>key[j]</code> is larger than <code>key[i]</code> and no larger than $k$;
in such a case, $j$ marks a position in the list that $i$ would have to
reach during an ordinary list search. Because the list is compact, we know
that in any choice of $j$ between $1$ and $n$ indexes some object in the
list rather than a slot on the free list.</p>

<p>Instead of analyzing the performance of <code>COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH</code> directly, we
shall analyze a related algorithm, <code>COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH'</code>, which executes
two separate loops. This algorithm takes an additional parameter $t$ which
determines an upper bound on the number of iterations of the first loop.</p>

<pre><code>COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH(L, n, k)
  i = L
  for q = 1 to t
      j = RANDOM(1, n)
      if key[i] &lt; key[j] and key[j] ≤ k
          i = j
          if key[i] == k
              return i
  while i ≠ ␀ and key[i] &lt; k
      i = next[i]
  if i == ␀ or key[i] &gt; k
      return ␀
  else
      return i
</code></pre>

<p>To compare the execution of the algorithms <code>COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH(L, n, k)</code>
and <code>COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH(L, n, k, t)</code>, assume that the sequence of integers
returned by the calls of <code>RANDOM(1, n)</code> is the same for both algorithms.</p>

<ol type="a">
  <li>Suppose that <code>COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH(L, n, k)</code> takes $t$
  iterations of the <strong>while</strong> loop of lines 2-8. Argue that
  <code>COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH'(L, n, k, t)</code> returns the same answer and
  that total number of iterations of both the <strong>for</strong> and
  <strong>while</strong> loops within <code>COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH'</code> is
  at least $t$.
</li>
</ol>

<p>In the call <code>COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH'(L, n, k, t)</code>, let $X_t$ be the random
variable that describes the distance in the linked list (that is, through
the chain of <em>next</em> pointers) from position $i$ in the desired key $k$ after
$t$ iterations of the <strong>for</strong> loop of lines 2-7 have occurred.</p>

<ol type="a" start="2">
  <li>Argue that the expected running time of <code>COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH'(L,
  n, k, t)</code> is $\O(t + \E[X_t])$.
  </li>
<li>Show that $\E[X_t] \le \sum_{r=1}^n(1 - r/n)^t$. (<i>Hint:</i> Use
  equation (C.25).)
  </li>
<li>Show that $\sum_{r=0}^{n-1} r^t \le n^{t+1}/(t + 1)$.
  </li>
<li>Prove that $\E[X_t] \le n/(t+1)$.
  </li>
<li>Show that <code>COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH'(L, n, k, t)</code> runs in $\O(t
  + n/t)$ expected time.
  </li>
<li>Conclude that <code>COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH</code> runs in $\O(\sqrt{n})$
  expected time.
  </li>
<li>Why do we assume that all keys are distinct in
  <code>COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH</code>? Argue that random skips do not
  necessarily help asymptotically when the list contains repeated key
  values.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a very interesting problem.</p>

<p>First, let's note that <code>COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH</code> a number of iterations, less or
equal to those of <code>COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH'</code>. If the first version found the
element on a random skip-ahead in $t$ iterations, so will the second version.
If not, the last $k$ iterations only advanced the pointer until the result was
found. Furthermore, none of the last $t - k$ iterations made a skip-ahead (by
the definition of $k$. Since the second version does not advance inbetween
skip-aheads, it has to perform $k$ additional iterations of its <strong>while</strong> loop
until the result is found.</p>

<p>Note also, that the first version minimizes the number of iterations. That is,
$t$ is picked in an optimal way.</p>

<p>Let's move on to the math. The expected running time of <code>COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH'</code>
is indeed $\O(t + \E[X_t])$, since it either finds the element in $t$
skip-aheads, or it has to move forward a number of times, equal to the
distance to $X_t$. Note that if the key is not present, this distance will
either be the successor of that key or the last element of the array, so the
analysis still holds.</p>

<p>Let's find the value of the expectation. The probability of having a distance
at least $r$ is the probability less than $r$. The probability of having
distance less than $k$ when $t = 1$ is $(n-r)/n$, thus:</p>

<p>$$ \Pr\{X_t \ge r\} = \bigg(\frac{n - r}{n}\bigg)^t
                      = \bigg(1 - \frac{r}{n}\bigg)^t$$</p>

<p>That is, one of the <code>RANDOM</code> calls should advance to the desired distance,
while the rest should advance to elements before it.</p>

<p>Using the (C.25), we get:</p>

<p>$$ \E[X_t] = \sum_{r=1}^{\infty} \Pr\{X_t \ge r\}
           = \sum_{r=1}^n \Pr\{X_t \ge r\}
           = \sum_{r=1}^n \bigg(1 - \frac{r}{n}\bigg)^t $$</p>

<p>The probability of getting distance, larger than $n$ is 0, so that's why we
can bound the sum index to $n$.</p>

<p>We can show (d) by approximating the sum with an integral with (A.11):</p>

<p>$$ \sum_{r=0}^{n-1} r^t \le \int_0^n x^t dx = \frac{n^{t+1}}{t+1} $$</p>

<p>This lets us give an upper bound on the expectation:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
   \E[X_t] &amp;= \sum_{r=1}^n \bigg(1 - \frac{r}{n}\bigg)^t \\
           &amp;= \sum_{r=0}^{n-1} \bigg(\frac{r}{n}\bigg)^t \\
           &amp;= \frac{1}{n^t} \sum_{r=0}^{n-1} r^t \\
           &amp;\le \frac{1}{n^t} \cdot \frac{n^{t+1}}{t + 1} \\
           &amp;= \frac{n}{t+1}
   \end{align} $$</p>

<p>The expected running time of <code>COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH'(L, n, k, t)</code> is thus:</p>

<p>$$ \O(t + \E[X_t]) = \O(t + n/(t+1)) = \O(t + n/t) $$</p>

<p>Since <code>COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH</code> minimizes this running time, we need to find the
minimum of $t + n/t$. The first derivative is $1 - n/t^2$ which is zero at
$\sqrt{n}$ and this is a local minimum. It's also the minimum in the interval
$[1,n]$.</p>

<p>This makes the expected running time of the first version of the algorithm
$\O(\sqrt{n})$.</p>

<p>As for duplicates, we won't be able to conclude (c) if there are duplicates.
The algorithm is able to skip ahead only if the value found by <code>RANDOM</code> is
greater than the current. For example, if we have a list of <code>0</code>s and we're
looking for a <code>1</code>, the algorithm will still need to iterate to the end of the
list, since it will not skip-ahead at all.</p>
