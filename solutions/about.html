      <h2>About</h2>

<p>
  I started this page as a way to share my solutions of <em>Introduction to
  Algorithms</em> exercies with a couple of friends, as we were going through
  the book together. As usual, life happened and I had to stop reading the book
  and focus on other things.
</p>

<p>
  I might eventually pick it up again. Until that happens, I won't be posting
  any new solutions.
</p>

<p>
  I'm trying to be careful when solving the exercies on a piece of paper (or
  with code), but I normally don't double check what I've written in the
  markdown. Thus, there might be a lot of errors in the solutions. No
  guarantees. If you would like to report any, please feel free to open a pull
  request in the <a href="https://github.com/skanev/playground">GitHub
  repo</a>. Or not :)
</p>

<p>
  I'm not trying to build an index of CLRS solutions here. Instead, I'm just
  taking notes and publishing them online for people who might find it useful.
  While I welcome any corrections, I want to stick with *my* solutions. I won't
  be publishing other people's solutions here. But if you would like to publish
  your own solutions, feel free to use the code in GitHub. You don't need to ask
  me if it is OK (it is), although I will be happy to learn that somebody found
  it useful.
