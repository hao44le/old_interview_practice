      <h1>Problem 5.2</h1>
<h2>Searching an unsorted array</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem examines three algorithms for searching for a value $x$ in an
unsorted array $A$ consisting for $n$ elements.</p>

<p>Consider the following randomized strategy: pick a random index $i$ into $A$.
If $A[i] = x$, then we terminate; otherwise, we continue the search by
picking a new random index into $A$. We continue picking random indices into
$A$ until we find an index $j$ such that $A[j] = x$ or until we have checked
every element of $A$. Note that we pick from the whole set of indices each
time, so that we may examine a given element more than once.</p>

<ol>
<li>Write pseudocode for a procedure <code>RANDOM-SEARCH</code> to implement the strategy
above. Be sure that your algorithm terminates when all indices into $A$
have been picked.</li>
<li>Suppose that there is exactly one index $i$ such that $A[i] = x$. What is
the expected number of indices into $A$ that we must pick before we find
$x$ and <code>RANDOM-SEARCH</code> terminates?</li>
<li>Generalizing your solution to part (b), suppose that there are $k \ge 1$
indices $i$ such that $A[i] = x$. What is the expected number of indices
into $A$ that we must pick before we find $x$ and <code>RANDOM-SEARCH</code>
terminates? Your answer should be a function of $n$ and $k$.</li>
<li>Suppose that there are no indices $i$ such that $A[i] = x$. What is the
expected number of indices into $A$ that we must pick before we have
checked all elements of $A$ and <code>RANDOM-SEARCH</code> terminates?</li>
</ol>

<p>Now consider a deterministic linear search algorithm, which we refer to as
<code>DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH</code>. Specifically, the algorithm searches $A$ for $x$ in
order, considering $A[1], A[2], A[3], \ldots, A[n]$ until either it finds
$A[i] = x$ or it reaches the end of the array. Assume that possible
permutations of the input array are equally likely.</p>

<ol>
<li>Suppose that there is exactly one index $i$ such that $A[i] = x$. What is
the average-case running time of <code>DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH</code>? What is the
worst-case running time of <code>DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH</code>?</li>
<li>Generalizing your solution to part (e), suppose that there are $k \ge 1$
indices $i$ such that $A[i] = x$. What is the average-case running time of
<code>DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH</code>? What is the worst-case running time of
<code>DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH</code>? Your answer should be a function of $n$ and $k$.</li>
<li>Suppose that there are no indices $i$ such that $A[i] = x$. What is the
average-case running time of <code>DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH</code>? What is the
worst-case running time of <code>DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH</code>?</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, consider a randomized algorithm <code>SCRAMBLE-SEARCH</code> that works by
first randomly permuting the input array and then running the deterministic
linear search given above on the resulting permuting array.</p>

<ol>
<li>Letting $k$ be the number of indices $i$ such that $A[i] = x$, give the
worst-case and expected running time of <code>SCRAMBLE-SEARCH</code> for the cases in
which $k = 0$ and $k = 1$. Generalizing your solution to handle the case
in which $k \ge 1$.</li>
<li>Which of the three searching algorithms would you use? Explain your
answer.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<h3>RANDOM-SEARCH pseudocode</h3>

<pre><code>RANDOM-SEARCH(x, A, n):
  v = ∅
  while |∅| ≠ n
      i = RANDOM(1, n)
      if A[i] = x
          return i
      else:
          v = v ∩ i
  return ␀
</code></pre>

<p><code>v</code> can be implemented in multiple ways - a hash table, a tree or a bitmap. The
last one would probabily perform best and consume the least space.</p>

<h3>RANDOM-SEARCH with one match</h3>

<p><code>RANDOM-SEARCH</code> is well-modelled by Bernoulli trials. The expected number of
picks is $n$.</p>

<h3>RANDOM-SEARCH with multiple matches</h3>

<p>In similar fashion, the expected number of picks is $n/k$.</p>

<h3>RANDOM-SEARCH with no matches</h3>

<p>This is modelled by the balls and bins problem, explored in section 5.4.2. The
answer is $n(\ln{n} + \O(1))$.</p>

<h3>DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH with one match</h3>

<p>The worst-case running time is $n$. The average-case is $(n+1)/2$ (obviously).</p>

<h3>DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH with multiple matches</h3>

<p>The worst-case running time is $n-k+1$. The average-case running time is
$(n+1)/(k+1)$. Let $X_i$ be an indicator random variable that the $i$th element
is a match. $\Pr\{X_i\} = 1/(k+1)$. Let $Y$ be an indicator random variable
that we have found a match after the first $n-k+1$ elements ($\Pr\{Y\} = 1$).
Thus:</p>

<p>$$ \E[X] = \E[X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_{n-k} + Y]
         = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n-k}\E[X_i]
         = 1 + \frac{n-k}{k+1}
         = \frac{n+1}{k+1} $$</p>

<h3>DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH with no matches</h3>

<p>Both the worst-case and average case is $n$.</p>

<h3>SCRAMBLE-SEARCH matches</h3>

<p>It's the same as <code>DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH</code>, only we replace "average-case" with "expected".</p>

<h3>Best algorithm</h3>

<p>Definitelly <code>DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH</code>. <code>SCRAMBLE-SEARCH</code> gives better expected
results, but for the cost of randomly permuting the array, which is a linear
operation. In the same time we could have scanned the full array and reported a
result.</p>
