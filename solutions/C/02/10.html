      <h1>Exercise C.2.10</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>$\star$ A prison warden has randomly picked one prisoner among three to go
free. The other two will be executed. The guard knows which one will go free
but is forbidden to give any prisoner information regarding his status. Let
us call the prisoners X, Y and Z. Prisoner X asks the guard privately which
of Y or Z will be executed, arguing that since he already knows that at least
one of them must die, the guard won't be revealing any information about his
own status. The guard tells X that Y is to be executed. Prisoner X feels
happier now, since he figures that either he or prisoner Z will go free,
which means that his probability of going free is now $1/2$. Is he right, or
are his chances still $1/3$? Explain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously the event took place before prisoner X obtained that knowledge and
this should not impact his chances in anyway.</p>

<p>But words are cheap, let's use math:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>y</strong> is the event of the guard saying prisoner Y will be executed</li>
<li>
<strong>X</strong>, <strong>Y</strong> and <strong>Z</strong> are the events of each prisoner going free</li>
<li>If X is going free, the guard has a 50% of saying Y is executed</li>
</ul>

<p>$$
\Pr\{y|X\} = \frac 1 2 \\
\Pr\{y\} = \Pr\{y \cap X\} + \Pr\{y \cap Y\} + \Pr\{y \cap Z\} = \frac 1 3 \cdot \frac 1 2 + \frac 1 3 \cdot 0 + \frac 1 3 \cdot 1 = \frac 1 6 + \frac 1 3 = \frac 1 2 \\
\Pr\{X|y\} = \frac{\Pr\{y|X\} \cdot \Pr\{X\}}{\Pr\{y\}} = \frac{\frac 1 2 \cdot \frac 1 3}{\frac 1 2} = \frac 1 3
